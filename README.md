##About Megamenu Magento extension
================
About 100$ is just too much for dropdown megamenu, so I am quite excited to announce the first FREE Megamenu extension available for Magento.

##Features

1 The menu is splitted into three parts:
- main categories on the left
- submenus in the middle (a submenu is visible when corresponding main category is hovered)
- category featured product on the right. Product image, title, price and add to cart button are displayed.

2 Completely dynamic. All you have to do is to regularly create categories and apply a featured product to them in the backend (read next item).

3 New, custom category attribute for storing featured product is automatically created for you when you install the module and run your store for the first time. You will see new tab, Featured product, and an input field waiting for you to insert featured product SKU.

4 Megamenu JavaScript is provided, along with jQuery version 1.9.1.

5 Recommended megamenu styling for Magento default theme is provided, but you should consider applying new styles for more appropriate look on your store design.
